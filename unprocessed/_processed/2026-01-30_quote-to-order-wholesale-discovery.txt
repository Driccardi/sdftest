Having a conversation with this customer.  They have a new Quote to Order Process.  They're using CRM in netsuite to handle building quotes for wholesale customers.  These are sports teams, that want custom designed frames in their sports colors.  These will appear as quotes in NetSuite (estimate record) and then will require the design team to step in and source custom designed frames.  We need to incorporate this process into the testing plan and the configuration plan.
