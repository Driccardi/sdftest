      <h2>1. Summary</h2>
      <p>SunStyle Retail currently processes e-commerce orders with basic fraud detection rules that flag orders with a fraud score above 75 for manual review. However, the existing system lacks a comprehensive framework for managing flagged orders, configuring fraud detection rules, and tracking review outcomes. This creates operational inefficiencies and increases the risk of revenue loss from fraudulent transactions while potentially delaying legitimate customer orders.</p>
      <p>This solution implements a configurable, rules-based fraud screening engine integrated directly into NetSuite's Order-to-Cash process. The system will automatically evaluate each incoming Sales Order against a set of customizable fraud detection rules, calculate a composite fraud risk score, and hold high-risk orders in a "Pending Fraud Review" status while reserving inventory to ensure availability for legitimate customers. A dedicated fraud review dashboard and daily saved search queue will enable Risk Management and Customer Service teams to efficiently review flagged orders and make informed approval or cancellation decisions.</p>
      <p>The solution provides complete visibility into fraud screening outcomes through comprehensive logging, reporting, and analytics capabilities. By maintaining inventory reservations during the review period, the system balances fraud prevention with customer experience. The architecture includes future-ready configuration options for automatic order cancellation based on configurable score thresholds, allowing SunStyle to evolve their fraud prevention strategy as transaction patterns and business needs change.</p>
      <p>This internal, NetSuite-native approach eliminates recurring per-transaction fees associated with third-party fraud detection services while providing full control over rule logic, scoring algorithms, and operational workflows.</p>

      <h2>4. Exception from Standard Functionality</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sales Order Processing:</strong> NetSuite's standard Sales Order workflow does not include configurable fraud screening rules, risk scoring, or automated order holds based on fraud indicators. This solution adds a fraud evaluation checkpoint before order approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Order Status Management:</strong> Standard NetSuite does not provide a "Pending Fraud Review" status that holds orders while maintaining inventory reservations. This solution extends the order status lifecycle to support fraud review workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>Inventory Reservation:</strong> Standard NetSuite inventory reservation logic does not account for orders held in fraud review status. Today, sales orders in any unapproved status have unreserved inventory, while orders in any approved status or pending fulfillment have reserved inventory. NetSuite does not allow creating a status between unapproved and approved or between unapproved and pending fulfillment. This solution implements a custom pattern to maintain inventory reservations for orders in "Pending Fraud Review" status while they await clearance.</li>
        <li><strong>User Notifications and Queues:</strong> NetSuite does not provide out-of-the-box fraud review dashboards, saved searches, or notification workflows for risk management teams. This solution creates specialized interfaces and notification mechanisms.</li>
        <li><strong>Configurable Rule Engine:</strong> NetSuite lacks a native fraud rule configuration interface that allows business users to define, weight, and tune fraud detection criteria without customization. This solution implements a user-manageable rule engine.</li>

      <h2>6. Assumptions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>SunStyle Retail's NetSuite account has Advanced Order Management or similar features enabled to support custom order statuses and workflows</li>
        <li>Sales Orders created through e-commerce channels are clearly identifiable (via sales channel field or similar indicator) to apply fraud screening selectively</li>
        <li>Current fraud score threshold of 75 (on 0-100 scale) will be migrated and refined within the new configurable rule system</li>
        <li>Risk Management and Customer Service teams have existing processes for reviewing suspicious orders and will adopt the new dashboard-based workflow</li>
        <li>Average daily volume of orders requiring fraud review is manageable within business hours (fewer than 50 orders per day flagged)</li>
        <li>Payment authorization has already occurred before fraud evaluation (payment holds are in place, but funds not yet captured)</li>
        <li>SunStyle Retail is using Stripe for online payments; Stripe is not providing any fraud signals or fraud detection capabilities, requiring NetSuite-native fraud screening</li>
        <li>Stripe supports authorization holds that remain valid during fraud review period (typically 7 days)</li>
        <li>A custom role for "Fraud Reviewer" will be created and implemented as part of this solution's technical design; users assigned this role will be responsible for order review and approval/cancellation decisions</li>
        <li>No integration with third-party fraud detection services (Signifyd, Kount, Riskified) is required; all fraud logic will be NetSuite-native</li>
        <li>Historical fraud and order data will be available to tune initial rule configurations and scoring thresholds</li>
        <li>Orders in fraud review will not be subject to standard "order aging" or "stale order" cleanup processes that might auto-cancel them</li>

      <h2>8. Technical Design</h2>

      <h3>8.1 Technical Design Summary</h3>
      <p>The fraud screening solution is implemented as an extension to NetSuite's standard Sales Order processing workflow using User Event scripts, custom fields, a custom record type for rule configuration, and a Suitelet-based dashboard for fraud review operations.</p>
      <p>When an e-commerce Sales Order is created, an <strong>afterSubmit</strong> User Event script executes immediately, retrieving active fraud detection rules from a custom configuration record. Each rule evaluates specific order attributes (order amount, shipping vs. billing address mismatch, velocity checks, customer history, IP geolocation, payment method, etc.) and returns a score contribution based on configured weights. The script aggregates individual rule scores into a composite fraud risk score (0-100 scale) and compares it against the configured review threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the script updates the Sales Order status to "Pending Fraud Review" and logs the complete evaluation (individual rule results, composite score, timestamp) to a custom Fraud Evaluation record linked to the Sales Order.</p>
      <p>Inventory reservations are maintained during fraud review because NetSuite's standard inventory commitment logic respects Sales Orders in any status except Cancelled/Closed. The custom "Pending Fraud Review" status is configured as a standard Sales Order status (not a cancellation or closure status), ensuring inventory remains committed until a fraud reviewer makes an approval or cancellation decision.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Fraud Review Dashboard</strong> is a custom Suitelet providing an interactive interface for fraud reviewers. The dashboard displays a real-time list of all Sales Orders in "Pending Fraud Review" status, showing fraud score, individual rule flags, customer history, order details, and time-in-queue metrics. Reviewers can select an order to view detailed information, add review notes, and execute approval or cancellation actions directly from the dashboard. Approval changes the Sales Order status to "Pending Fulfillment" (or the next standard status in SunStyle's workflow), allowing normal order processing to proceed. Cancellation updates the status to "Cancelled," triggers inventory release, processes a refund via payment gateway integration, and logs the cancellation reason.</p>
      <p>A <strong>Scheduled Script</strong> runs daily at 8:00 AM to generate and email a saved search report summarizing all orders currently awaiting fraud review, including order age, score, and assigned reviewer. This ensures the Risk Management team maintains visibility and meets review SLA commitments.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Fraud Rule Configuration Record</strong> is a custom record type that stores individual fraud detection rules. Each rule record defines: rule name, evaluation logic (implemented as a formula or scripted function reference), scoring weight (0-100), active/inactive status, rule priority/sequence, and optional threshold parameters. Business users with appropriate permissions can create, edit, activate, or deactivate rules through standard NetSuite record interfaces, enabling ongoing tuning without developer intervention. A library of pre-built rule templates (amount thresholds, address validation, velocity checks, etc.) is provided to accelerate initial configuration.</p>
      <p>The solution includes comprehensive <strong>logging and audit trails</strong>. Each fraud evaluation creates a Fraud Evaluation Log record (custom record) capturing: Sales Order reference, evaluation timestamp, individual rule results (JSON structure), composite fraud score, decision outcome, reviewer identity (if manually reviewed), review timestamp, and decision rationale. This audit trail supports compliance requirements, fraud analytics, and continuous improvement initiatives.</p>
      <p>Future support for <strong>automatic cancellation</strong> is enabled through a configuration field on the rule settings: "Auto-Cancel Threshold." When populated (e.g., 95), the User Event script will immediately cancel orders exceeding this score without manual review, sending notifications to the Risk Management team. This field is initially left blank (null), requiring all flagged orders to undergo manual review. When SunStyle is ready to implement auto-cancellation, the Risk Manager can populate this threshold value through the configuration interface.</p>
      <p>All scripts follow NetSuite governance best practices, including try-catch error handling, governance usage monitoring, and fail-safe defaults (if fraud evaluation fails due to script error, the order is flagged for manual review rather than being automatically approved).</p>

      </table>

      <h3>8.6 Error Handling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Validation Errors:</strong> If fraud evaluation cannot complete due to missing required order data (e.g., shipping address, payment method), the order is automatically flagged for manual review with error details logged to the Fraud Evaluation Log record. Users see a warning message on the Sales Order form indicating incomplete fraud evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>System Errors:</strong> If the fraud evaluation script encounters a system error (governance limit, API timeout, database error), the script logs the error to NetSuite's Execution Log with full stack trace and order context. The order is placed in "Pending Fraud Review" status (fail-safe: err on the side of caution). Email notification is sent to NetSuite administrators with error details. The daily report includes orders with evaluation errors for manual processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Errors:</strong> If fraud rule configuration data is invalid (e.g., malformed JSON in rule parameters, circular dependencies), the specific rule is skipped and an error is logged. Evaluation continues with remaining valid rules. The Fraud Settings record includes a "Strict Mode" checkbox; when enabled, any rule configuration error halts the entire evaluation and flags the order for manual review.</li>
        <li><strong>Logging:</strong> All fraud evaluations, errors, and review actions are logged to custom Fraud Evaluation Log records with detailed context (order ID, timestamp, rule results, errors, decisions). Critical errors (script failures, payment gateway errors) are also logged to NetSuite's system Execution Log and generate email alerts to administrators. Logs are retained for 2 years for compliance and analytics purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>User Notification:</strong> Fraud reviewers are notified of orders awaiting review through: (1) Dashboard badge showing pending count, (2) Daily email report, (3) Optional real-time email/Slack notification for high-priority orders (score &gt; 90). Customers receive a generic "Order Received - Under Review" email when their order is flagged, with estimated review completion time (24 hours). Upon approval, customers receive standard "Order Confirmed" email; upon cancellation, customers receive "Order Cancelled - Fraud Prevention" email with refund details and appeal instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> If an order is stuck in "Pending Fraud Review" status beyond the configured hold duration (default: 7 days), a Scheduled Script identifies these orders and either auto-approves them (if score &lt; 85) or escalates to Risk Manager for decision. Payment authorization validity is checked before approval; if expired, the script attempts to re-authorize or flags for manual payment collection. Inventory released by cancellation is immediately available for other orders. All recovery actions are logged to audit trail with system-generated rationale.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.7 Performance Considerations &amp; Expected Volumes</h3>
      <p>The fraud evaluation engine is designed to execute within NetSuite governance limits for User Event scripts (10,000 governance units). Each fraud rule evaluation consumes approximately 50-150 governance units depending on complexity (database lookups for customer history, external API calls for address validation). The initial rule set is limited to 20 active rules to ensure evaluation completes within governance budget. Complex rules requiring extensive data analysis (e.g., multi-order velocity checks across date ranges) will use Scheduled Scripts for pre-calculation and caching rather than real-time evaluation.</p>
      <p>The Fraud Review Dashboard Suitelet uses efficient saved search queries with appropriate filters and column selection to render quickly (target: &lt; 2 seconds for dashboard load). Pagination is implemented for environments with &gt; 50 pending orders. The dashboard uses RESTlet-based backend APIs to minimize page reloads during approval/cancellation actions.</p>
      <p>Daily report generation uses saved searches optimized with indexed fields (<code>custbody_ns_fraud_review_status</code>, <code>custbody_ns_fraud_eval_timestamp</code>) to execute efficiently even with large order volumes.</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Volume Metric</th><th>Expected Value</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
        <tr><td>E-Commerce Orders Created</td><td>200-500 orders</td><td>Per day</td><td>All e-commerce orders undergo fraud evaluation</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Orders Flagged for Review</td><td>10-30 orders (5-10% of total)</td><td>Per day</td><td>Based on current 75 threshold and expected fraud patterns</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fraud Rules Evaluated</td><td>15-20 rules</td><td>Per order (during creation)</td><td>Each order evaluated against all active rules; ~2,000-10,000 rule evaluations/day</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Governance Units per Evaluation</td><td>1,500-3,000 units</td><td>Per order evaluation</td><td>Well within 10,000 unit User Event limit</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fraud Evaluation Log Records Created</td><td>200-500 records</td><td>Per day</td><td>One log record per order evaluated</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Dashboard Page Loads</td><td>50-100 page loads</td><td>Per day</td><td>Fraud reviewers checking dashboard throughout the day</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Manual Reviews Completed</td><td>10-30 reviews</td><td>Per day</td><td>Matches flagged order volume</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Daily Report Email Recipients</td><td>3-5 users</td><td>Once per day</td><td>Risk Manager, Customer Service Manager, Operations Lead</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fraud Configuration Changes</td><td>5-10 changes</td><td>Per month</td><td>Rule adjustments, threshold tuning, adding new rules</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p><strong>Scalability Considerations:</strong> If SunStyle's order volume grows significantly (&gt; 1,000 orders/day), the fraud evaluation logic will be refactored to use a Map/Reduce script for batch processing rather than User Event inline evaluation. This approach would process orders asynchronously within minutes of creation, removing governance constraints while maintaining near-real-time fraud detection. The current User Event architecture supports up to ~1,000 orders/day comfortably; beyond that, Map/Reduce becomes necessary.</p>
      <p><strong>Caching Strategy:</strong> Customer history metrics (lifetime order value, previous fraud flags, return rate) will be cached in custom fields on the Customer record and updated nightly via Scheduled Script, rather than calculated in real-time during fraud evaluation. This reduces governance consumption and improves evaluation performance.</p>

      <h2>10. AI Use Opportunities</h2>
      <p>The fraud screening solution is an ideal candidate for future AI/ML enhancement to improve fraud detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and enable predictive risk scoring based on emerging patterns. As SunStyle accumulates historical fraud evaluation data (approved vs. cancelled orders with associated attributes), machine learning models can be trained to refine scoring algorithms beyond rule-based logic.</p>
      <p><strong>Identified Opportunities:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning Fraud Model:</strong> Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network) on historical order data labeled with fraud outcomes (legitimate vs. fraudulent). The model would learn complex, non-linear relationships between order attributes (amount, customer history, device fingerprint, order timing, product mix, etc.) and fraud probability, producing more accurate risk scores than weighted rule summation. This model could be integrated as an additional "ML Rule" in the fraud evaluation engine, contributing its predicted probability to the composite score.</li>
        <li><strong>Anomaly Detection for Emerging Fraud Patterns:</strong> Implement unsupervised learning (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to identify orders with unusual attribute combinations that don't match historical fraud patterns but represent potential new fraud vectors. This detects "zero-day" fraud techniques not covered by existing rules and alerts Risk Managers to investigate and create new rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing for Review Notes Analysis:</strong> Apply NLP sentiment analysis and topic modeling to fraud reviewer notes accumulated over time. This identifies common fraud indicators mentioned by reviewers ("customer nervous", "phone number disconnected", "shipping to freight forwarder") and suggests new automated rule criteria based on patterns found in manual review rationale.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive False Positive Reduction:</strong> Train a model to predict which high-scoring orders are likely false positives (legitimate customers exhibiting fraud-like patterns) based on features like customer tenure, previous order history, and review outcomes. Orders predicted as false positives could be auto-approved or fast-tracked for quick review, reducing review workload and improving customer experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Threshold Optimization:</strong> Use reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization to continuously tune the fraud review threshold (currently static at 75) based on evolving fraud patterns, false positive costs, and review capacity. The system would recommend threshold adjustments to optimize the balance between fraud prevention and operational efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud Network Analysis (Graph ML):</strong> Build a graph database connecting customers, payment methods, shipping addresses, IP addresses, and devices. Apply graph neural networks or community detection algorithms to identify fraud rings (multiple accounts controlled by the same fraudster) and shared fraud indicators across seemingly unrelated orders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Implementation Considerations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Requirements:</strong> Minimum 6-12 months of historical order data with confirmed fraud outcomes (at least 200 fraudulent orders and 5,000 legitimate orders) to train effective models. Data must include rich feature set: customer demographics, order attributes, behavioral data (clickstream, session duration), and external enrichment (IP geolocation, device fingerprinting).</li>
        <li><strong>Integration Architecture:</strong> AI models would be deployed outside NetSuite (on cloud ML platforms like AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, or Google Vertex AI) and integrated via RESTlet APIs. The fraud evaluation script would call the ML model endpoint for prediction, incorporating the AI-generated risk score into the composite fraud score calculation. Model predictions would be cached to manage API call volume and costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Governance and Monitoring:</strong> Implement MLOps practices including model versioning, A/B testing (compare rule-based vs. AI-enhanced scoring), performance monitoring (accuracy, false positive/negative rates), and model retraining pipelines. Human reviewers should be able to override AI predictions and provide feedback to improve model quality. Bias testing and fairness analysis are critical to ensure the model doesn't discriminate based on protected customer attributes (e.g., geography, demographics).</li>
        <li><strong>Explainability and Transparency:</strong> Use interpretable ML techniques (SHAP values, LIME, feature importance) to explain why the AI model flagged a specific order. Reviewers need to understand AI reasoning to trust predictions and identify model errors. Fraud review dashboard should display both rule-based flags and AI-driven risk factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis:</strong> Evaluate per-transaction API call costs for ML inference vs. prevented fraud losses and reduced manual review costs. Start with batch-based inference (daily model scoring of previous day's orders) to minimize costs before moving to real-time inference if ROI justifies.</li>
        <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Clearly distinguish AI-driven scores from rule-based scores in the fraud review interface. Provide training to fraud reviewers on interpreting AI predictions and understanding model limitations. Gradually increase reliance on AI as model accuracy improves and reviewer confidence grows.</li>
      </ul>
