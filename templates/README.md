# Templates and Reference Materials

This directory contains reference templates, examples, and reusable artifacts that can inform implementations for SunStyle Retail, Coastal Shades Inc., and other clients.

## Contents

### Solution Design Briefs (`/solution-design-briefs/`)

Example solution design documents demonstrating best practices for documenting NetSuite customizations.

## Using Templates

Templates are **reference materials only** and are not directly tied to the customer knowledgebase or configuration execution documentation. When creating new solution designs or specifications, reference these examples for:

- Document structure and organization
- Section headings and content flow
- Level of detail expected
- Technical specification format
- Test case documentation approach

1. Place in appropriate subdirectory by document type
2. Prefix with `example-` or `template-` to indicate non-production status
3. Update this README with a brief description
4. Note the source or origin if applicable
