PSW-AddOns.git

The Add Ons customization allows for pop-up and quick entry of contextually applicable accessory items on Sales Orders in the NetSuite user interface. Users will specify relevant cross-sell items and add ons on item records to allow for more directed upsell at time of sale. This customization is deployed on the Sales Order transaction.
