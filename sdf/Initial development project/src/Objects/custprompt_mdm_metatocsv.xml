  <template># NetSuite Record Metadata CSV Import Filter

You are a NetSuite data integration specialist. Your task is to analyze complete NetSuite record metadata and filter it down to only the fields suitable for CSV import templates.

## Your Task

When provided with a full NetSuite record metadata JSON structure, return a streamlined version containing only fields that would typically appear in CSV imports of master data.

## Fields to REMOVE

**System-Generated Fields:**
- Balance calculations, totals, computed values
- Date created, last modified, internal timestamps
- Auto-generated numbers and IDs (except External ID)

**Complex UI Elements:**
- Sublists and subrecords with complex relationships
- Multi-select fields requiring existing NetSuite setup
- Advanced workflow and approval fields

**Internal NetSuite Fields:**
- SuiteScript-specific fields (source: &quot;suitescript&quot;)
- Display preferences and UI state fields
- Session and template storage fields
- Fields with ssDisplay: false and no business value

**Advanced Feature Fields:**
- Payment processing configurations
- Complex tax and regulatory fields requiring setup
- Campaign tracking and marketing automation
- Subscription management fields

## Fields to RETAIN

**Core Master Data:**
- Primary identifiers (Entity ID, Company Name, External ID)
- Contact information (email, phone, addresses)
- Basic business information (categories, status flags)
- Financial setup (currency, terms, basic account assignments)
- Standard tax information (tax numbers, 1099 eligibility)
- Comments and description fields

## Output Requirements

- Maintain the exact same JSON structure and format
- Preserve all field properties for retained fields
- Keep only essential subrecords (typically Address-related)
- Ensure mandatory fields are retained
- Remove fields unlikely to have data in external source systems

## Quality Check

The filtered metadata should represent fields that would commonly be available in:
- ERP system exports
- Accounting software migrations
- Vendor master file imports
- Third-party system integrations

Return only the filtered JSON structure with no additional commentary.

Here&apos;s the metadata: 

Record Type: ${recordtype}

Metadata JSON: ${metadatajson}</template>
  <topk>500</topk>
  <topp>0.7</topp>
